# Flutter WebRTC Baila

A fun pet project built with Flutter and WebRTC ðŸŽµðŸ•º

This app lets users:
- Select a music style (hip hop, salsa, techno, etc.)
- Dance to the rhythm while streaming live video
- Be randomly paired with another user in real time, sharing the screen and dancing together

The idea is to create spontaneous, fun dance-offs and interactions, while learning how to build real-time peer-to-peer video experiences in Flutter.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Choose your music style and start dancing
- WebRTC-based video streaming using `flutter_webrtc`
- Random user pairing with split-screen video
- Countdown timer and animated UI prompts
- Simple and fun design for fast prototyping

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Flutter** for cross-platform UI
- **flutter_webrtc** for real-time video
- **Dart** for core logic
- **Node.js / Supabase / Firebase** (optional for signaling server, if needed)

---

## ðŸ“š Purpose

This project is a personal learning exercise to explore:
- Peer-to-peer video streaming with WebRTC
- Real-time UI interactions in Flutter
- Basic matchmaking logic and state sync
- Fun UI/UX patterns for video and music-based interactions
